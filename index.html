        <h2>Drumming</h2>
          <p>I play the drums and genereal percussion since I am 9 years old. I've plaed in several bands and has always been a pleasure. I think music conects people, it doesn't matter, which language you speak.</p>

        <h2>Running</h2>
          <p>I have started running when I was 20 years old and got obsessed with it from the beginnning. Until I had a foot surgery I was running frequently, after I am able to run 2 - 3 times a week, which is totally enough.</p>

          <p>Traveling is my biggest passion I can share with my girlfriend. Sind we're a couple we visited many different countries, like Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Iceland, Spain, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Turkey, Portugal, UK, Ireland and USA. Unlucky, it is not possible during Corona. </p>
